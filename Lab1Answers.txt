1. Masking by HSV value seems to work better. For RGB, white objects/backgrounds have high blue
values, so they may be mistaken as blue. This is not solved by limiting the red and green
upper thresholds, as the notebook is no longer detected (it is a light blue).
The threshold range I used for HSV was (80-110), which worked quite well. This could be
decreased further, but the notebook I was trying to track is a relatively large object in
frame, so this range ended up performing best.

2. Using the flashlight on my phone, I shined a light on the notebook from various angles.
This did not significantly impact the HSV masking performance, but it severly impaired
the RGB mask's ability, as the bright white light is detected as blue, and the largest
contour is no longer the notebook.

3. The program tracks the phone well for HSV masking, but poorly for RGB masking. At the
highest brightness levels, the phone appears on screen as almost white, and the program
does not track too well. For the lowest brightness level, it works just about perfectly.

4. In my enviornment, it is very bright, so the phone has a lot of glare which significantly
changes the color it appears as on camera. However, this is an issue with the camera, rather
than the program. However, at minimum brightness on my phone, the color is more robust to
change than the object, as the object is reflecting light in the room, whereas the phone
is emitting its own light.

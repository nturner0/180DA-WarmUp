For our project, we plan to have two unique interfaces. One will be client end, for as many users
as needed. This will display to the player different menus to select their mode of input, as
well as their input move and windows for recording gestures or speech. On the main end, we
will display the game (Pokemon, Street Fighter, etc.), as well as the last ~5 or so moves that
players have made. For the graphics, we will use an image of the game, so we will only
need to overlay the additional information, for which the PyGame will work well enough.
